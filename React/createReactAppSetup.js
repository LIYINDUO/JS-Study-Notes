// $ mkdir react
// $ cd react

// $ npm install -g create-react-app 
// $ create-react-app helloworld

// NOTE* create-react-app needs NODE version => 8 or higher 
// To update Node And some other idea candies 
// Find out which version of Node.js you are using:

// node --version
// Find out which versions of Node.js you may have installed and which one of those you're currently using:

// nvm ls
// List all versions of Node.js available for installation:

// nvm ls-remote
// Apparently for Windows the command would be rather like this:

// nvm ls available
// Assuming you would pick Node.js v8.1.0 for installation you'd type the following to install that version:

// nvm install 8.1.0
// You are then free to choose between installed versions of Node.js. So if you would need to use an older version like v4.2.0 you would set it as the active version like this:

// nvm use 4.2 

// $ cd helloworld
// $ npm start
