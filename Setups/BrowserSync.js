// sudo npm install -g browser-sync

// browser-sync start --proxy 'url' --no-notify

//browser-sync start --proxy 'http://localhost:3000/' --no-notify

// This way works for me in dev enviroment for create react app 

// To use browser sync locally in dev dependancies one need to init it in gulp. However,

// I don't wish to install gulp while its functions are mostly replaced by the CRA set ups.

// So install browser sync globally will have to do.
